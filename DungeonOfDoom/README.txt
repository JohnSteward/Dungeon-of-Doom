How to start the game:
	You must first input the name of the text file that contains the map(but without the extension). For example,
	if the map is called 'default_map.txt', you just need to input 'default_map'.
	The text file with the map you want must be in the same folder as the java project, or it will not find the
	file. If the file is not found, the program will load the default map.

How to play:
	At the start of the game, your character and a bot character will be placed randomly on the map that you chose,
	and the objective is for you to pickup all the gold that is required to win the game, and find an exit tile to 
	be able to leave and win the game.
	Your possible inputs are:
		HELLO:
			This shows you the total amount of gold that is required to win on this map.
		GOLD:
			This shows you the amount of gold that you currently have.
		PICKUP:
			If you are standing on a gold tile, you will pickup the gold there, and the amount of gold
			that you currently have will increase by 1. If you aren't on a gold tile, nothing will happen.
		QUIT: 
			If you are on an exit tile with the required amount of gold, you will leave the dungeon and
			win the game. In any other case, however, you will lose the game.
		LOOK:
			This is the only way for you to view the map during the game. It will show you a 5x5 grid of 
			the surrounding area, with your character in the centre.
		MOVE N:
			This will move you up one space if there isn't a wall above you. If there is, nothing will
			happen.
		MOVE S:
			This will move you down one space if there isn't a wall below you. If there is, nothing will
			happen.
		MOVE W:
			This will move you left one space if there isn't a wall to the left of you. If there is, nothing 
			will happen.
		MOVE E:
			This will move you right one space if there isn't a wall to the right of you. If there is, nothing
			will happen.
	All of these commands take up your turn, even if they are invalid movements or if you made a typo.
	If the bot catches you, you lose the game.
	
	The bot will move randomly around the map, but uses the LOOK command every 3 turns and, if your character is within
	the 5x5 grid generated by the bot, it will start chasing you until it reaches the position that it saw you in. Once
	it reaches that position, it will start moving randomly again.
